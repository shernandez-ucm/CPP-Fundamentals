Read and solve the Kattis problem: https://open.kattis.com/problems/doggopher

Algorithm Steps:
        1. Read gopher and dog's coordinates
        2. Define a function to find and return the Euclidean distance between the two points
    3. For each gopher hole coordinate:
      3.a find the distance between the gopher position and the hole
      3.b find the distance between the dog position and the hole
      4.c if the dog's distance is larger or equal to twice the distance of gopher,
          gopher can get away through that hole.
          4.c.1 Stop testing other holes.
    4. If no safe hole is found, the gopher cannot escape.
