# CS1 Lab - Standard Input and Output - 1

Possible Points: 100

- Write a C++ program to solve the Kattis problemid echoechoecho: [https://open.kattis.com/problems/echoechoecho](https://open.kattis.com/problems/echoechoecho). Note that the last part of the URL, e.g. `echoechoecho` is the problem id. Read the problem statement carefully to design a correct solution.
- Always write algorithm steps as comments before coding.
- Always write code that follows best programming practices.

## Type and fix the code

1. Create the directory structure similar to this lab as shown below:

```bash
ascii_art/
├── data/
├── ascii_art.cpp
├── Makefile
├── README.md
└── screenshots/
```

2. Type the contents provided in `.h` and `.cpp` files and fix all fixmes. Write #fixed# after each #fixme.
3. Follow best programming practices by using proper white spaces, comments, etc.

### Input and Output format

- Never prompt user telling what data to enter for Kattis problems. Kattis knows what to enter.
- Directly read the input. Print only the answer as displayed in the sample output.
- Print as asked: nothing less; nothing more!
- Kattis is a computer program that provides specific input and expects exact output – to a space to give the correct verdict.

## Whole program test with Kattis-cli

1. Test the whole program using Kattis-cli. While testing, provide input using the same format as described in the Input section and shown in input samples.
2. Add three new input and corresponding output files like the sample files inside data folder (10 points)
3. Test locally and submit to Kattis once all the tests pass

```bash
kattis test
kattis submit
```

## Submission

1. Create at least 3 screenshots showing your local tests (kattis test and make doctest) and the kattis final **Accept** verdict and save them to the **screenshots** folder. (10 points).
2. Update the `README.md` file (10 points) as shown here: https://github.com/rambasnet/csXXX-rbasnet

```bash
cd <main repo folder>
ls
git pull
git status
git add <each file in the red that is part of this lab>
git status
git commit -m "write brief description of what was done"
git push
git status
```

3. Make sure the files are actually pushed to your remote GitHub repo.
