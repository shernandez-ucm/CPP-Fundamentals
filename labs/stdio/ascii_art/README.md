# CS1 Lab - Standard Input and Output - 1

## Possible Points: 100

- write a C++ program that produces the following output on console:

```text
    |\_/|       *******************************     (\_/)
    / @ @ \     *      ASCII Art              *    (='.'=)
   ( > 0 < )    *      Author: <Your Name>    *  ( " )_( " )
     >>x<<      *      CS Foundation Course   *
     / O \       *******************************
```

- Always write algorithm steps as comments before coding.
- Always write code that follows best programming practices.

## Type and fix the code

1. Create the directory structure similar to this lab as shown below:

```bash
ascii_art/
├── data/
├── ascii_art.cpp
├── Makefile
├── README.md
└── screenshots/
```

2. Type the contents provided in `.h` and `.cpp` files and fix all fixmes. Write #fixed# after each #fixme.
3. Follow best programming practices by using proper white spaces, comments, etc.

### Input and Output format

- Never prompt user telling what data to enter for Kattis problems. Kattis knows what to enter.
- Directly read the input. Print only the answer as displayed in the sample output.
- Print as asked: nothing less; nothing more!
- Kattis is a computer program that provides specific input and expects exact output – to a space to give the correct verdict.

## Whole program test with Kattis-cli

1. Build, run and manually test the whole program using the Makefile provided
2. Create screenshots of the output console showing the correct output as shown above.

## Submission

1. Create at least 1 screenshot showing your local tests and save it to the **screenshots** folder. (10 points).
2. Update the `README.md` file (10 points) as shown here: https://github.com/rambasnet/csXXX-rbasnet

```bash
cd <main repo folder>
ls
git pull
git status
git add <each file in the red that is part of this lab>
git status
git commit -m "write brief description of what was done"
git push
git status
```

3. Make sure the files are actually pushed to your remote GitHub repo.
